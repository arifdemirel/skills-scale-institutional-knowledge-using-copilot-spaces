## OctoAcme Project Management at a Glance

### Core Principles
Our project management approach is built on these foundational principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments rather than big-bang releases
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead (PdM)
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

### Key Roles
Understanding who does what is essential for effective collaboration:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide input, feedback, and approvals

### Project Lifecycle Stages

Every OctoAcme project flows through these stages:

#### 1. **Initiation**
Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and define success criteria.
- **Key outputs**: Project one-pager, stakeholder list, initial timeline, risk list
- **Decision gate**: Approve to move into planning when metrics and priority are clear

ðŸ‘‰ [Detailed initiation guide](octoacme-project-initiation.md)

#### 2. **Planning**
Turn the approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog.
- **Key activities**: Kickoff meeting, backlog creation, estimation, release planning
- **Key outputs**: Prioritized backlog, Definition of Done, release plan, risk register

ðŸ‘‰ [Detailed planning guide](octoacme-project-planning.md)

#### 3. **Execution & Tracking**
Build, test, review, and iterate toward milestones.
- **Team rhythm**: Daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, sprint demos
- **Quality focus**: Automated testing, code reviews, security scanning
- **Tracking**: Project boards, velocity metrics, risk register updates

ðŸ‘‰ [Detailed execution guide](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)

#### 4. **Release & Deployment**
Deploy to production with confidence and observability.
- **Release types**: Patch (hotfixes), Minor (features), Major (breaking changes)
- **Key activities**: Pre-release checklist, staged rollout, smoke testing, announcement
- **Safety**: Rollback plans, incident response procedures

ðŸ‘‰ [Detailed release guide](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)

#### 5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.
- **When**: After each sprint, release, milestone, or incident
- **Focus**: What went well, what to improve, and concrete action items
- **Follow-through**: Track improvements in backlog with owners and timelines

ðŸ‘‰ [Detailed retrospective guide](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)

### Key Artifacts
Projects generate and maintain these important documents:

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Problem statement, goals, success metrics
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: Timeline, milestones, dependencies
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Definition of Done**: Quality standards and completion criteria
- **Risk Register**: Identified risks, impacts, mitigations, owners
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items from reviews

### Communication Cadence
Consistent communication keeps everyone aligned:

- **Daily**: Team standups (15 min) for progress and blockers
- **Twice weekly**: Delivery team syncs (as agreed with team)
- **Weekly**: PM + PdM alignment, risk register reviews
- **Monthly**: Stakeholder updates and roadmap reviews
- **Ad-hoc**: Escalations and incident communications as needed
