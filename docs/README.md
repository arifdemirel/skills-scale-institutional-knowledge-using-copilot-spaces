# OctoAcme Project Management: Quick Start Guide

Welcome to OctoAcme! This README provides a high-level overview of how we manage projects, making it easy for new team members to understand our approach and find the detailed documentation they need.

## Purpose and Scope

OctoAcme's project management framework provides a concise, shareable approach to running cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, and integrations. Our goal is to enable new teammates to quickly understand our processes, roles, and key artifacts so they can contribute effectively.

**Scope**: This framework applies to all cross-functional projects involving product development, feature releases, and service integrations.

## Core Principles

Our project management approach is guided by five fundamental principles:

1. **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
2. **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to enable fast feedback
3. **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead with defined responsibilities
4. **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence rather than assumptions
5. **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement without blame

## Key Roles and Responsibilities

### Project Manager (PM)
- Coordinates delivery activities, schedules, and timelines
- Manages risks, dependencies, and resource constraints
- Facilitates meetings (kickoff, planning, retrospectives)
- Ensures consistent project documentation and status reporting
- Coordinates cross-team and stakeholder communication

### Product Manager (PdM)
- Defines problem statements and success metrics
- Prioritizes the roadmap and backlog
- Collaborates with stakeholders and engineering on trade-offs
- Validates solutions through user research and metrics
- Owns product vision and outcomes

### Developers
- Implement features and fixes to meet acceptance criteria
- Write and maintain tests and documentation
- Participate in design and code reviews
- Assist in estimating and planning work
- Help identify technical risks and propose mitigations

### QA/Testing
- Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- Design and execute test plans
- Ensure features meet quality standards before release
- Identify and report defects

### Stakeholders
- Provide inputs, requirements, and constraints
- Review progress and provide feedback
- Grant approvals for key decisions and releases
- Champion the project within their areas

## Project Lifecycle Stages

### 1. Initiation
**Purpose**: Validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan.

**Key Activities**:
- Confirm business need and measurable outcomes
- Identify stakeholders and champions
- Define success criteria and initial timeline
- Decide go/no-go for planning

**Deliverables**: Project one-pager, stakeholder list, high-level timeline, initial risk list

ðŸ“– [Detailed Process: Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md)

### 2. Planning
**Purpose**: Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog.

**Key Activities**:
- Break work into shippable increments
- Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
- Estimate scope and define Definition of Done
- Identify dependencies and create release plan
- Conduct project kickoff meeting

**Deliverables**: Prioritized backlog, release timeline, risk register, Definition of Done

ðŸ“– [Detailed Process: Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)

### 3. Execution & Tracking
**Purpose**: Manage day-to-day execution and track progress toward milestones.

**Key Activities**:
- Daily standups (15 min) focusing on progress and blockers
- Weekly delivery sync to review progress and risks
- Sprint/milestone demos and reviews
- Continuous testing and quality validation
- Regular risk register updates

**Deliverables**: Working software increments, test results, velocity metrics, status updates

ðŸ“– [Detailed Process: Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)

### 4. Release & Deployment
**Purpose**: Standardize how features are released to production to reduce risk.

**Key Activities**:
- Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- Run comprehensive smoke tests
- Deploy to staging, then production
- Execute rollback plan if needed
- Announce release to stakeholders

**Deliverables**: Release notes, deployment checklist, smoke test results, rollback plan

ðŸ“– [Detailed Process: Release & Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)

### 5. Retrospective & Continuous Improvement
**Purpose**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

**Key Activities**:
- Review what went well and what could improve
- Identify 2-3 prioritized action items
- Assign owners and due dates
- Track action items to completion

**Deliverables**: Retrospective notes, action items, improvement metrics

ðŸ“– [Detailed Process: Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)

## Communication Cadence

Consistent communication keeps everyone aligned and informed:

- **Daily standups**: 15-minute team sync on progress, blockers, and dependencies
- **Weekly PM + PdM sync**: Alignment on priorities, risks, and decisions
- **Twice-weekly delivery team standups**: Or as agreed by the team
- **Sprint/milestone demos**: Show progress and gather feedback
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: High-level status and key decisions
- **Ad-hoc escalations**: As needed for critical issues

ðŸ“– [Detailed Process: Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)

## Key Artifacts

These documents and tools support project delivery:

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Problem statement, goals, success metrics, stakeholders
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: Timeline, milestones, and deliverables
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done**: Clear standards for completion
- **Risk Register**: Identified risks with impact, likelihood, and mitigation plans
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items for improvement
- **Release Notes**: Summary of changes, migrations, and known issues

- [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) - Detailed role definitions and goals
- [Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) - Risk lifecycle and communication templates

### Best Practices
- Keep the Project Charter updated in the project repository
- Add process-specific docs to `.copilot/` for Copilot Spaces context
- Use GitHub Projects for tracking with standard workflow columns
- Maintain small PRs (â‰¤400 lines when possible) with clear descriptions
- Run automated tests and linting before requesting reviews
- Update the risk register weekly during execution
- Celebrate improvements and successes with the team

## Getting Started

1. **New to a project?** Start by reading the project one-pager to understand the problem, goals, and success metrics
2. **Need to understand your role?** Review the [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) document
3. **Starting a new project?** Follow the [Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md) guide
4. **Planning a sprint?** Use the [Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md) templates and checklists
5. **Questions or feedback?** Reach out to your PM or use retrospectives to suggest improvements
